This companion course supports the lecture series on Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics aimed at grammar school teachers. We revisit each lecture topic with classroom-oriented explanations that bridge the university content and the expectations of A-level physics curricula.

Across the semester we focus on three threads:

- bringing formal derivations down to qualitative models that can be discussed with advanced secondary pupils;
- surfacing classroom-ready analogies, experiments, and discussion prompts that demystify relativity and quantum concepts;
- curating didactic tips, misconceptions, and follow-up activities teachers can integrate immediately.
